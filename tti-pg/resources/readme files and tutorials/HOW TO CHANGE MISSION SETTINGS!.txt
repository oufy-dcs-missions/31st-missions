HOW TO CHANGE MISSION SETTINGS:


GO TO THE TRIGGER LIST IN THE MISSION EDITOR (3rd icon under MIS on the LEFT PANEL)

On the FIRST TRIGGER, look in ACTIONS > DO SCRIPT.

There you can edit the number values for adjusting the mission properties.

AFTER EDITING, SAVE MISSION!!!!!

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE NUMBER VALUES!!!

This is what each setting does:


a2g_easy_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want A2G Easy missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g  hard missions active)
a2g_hard_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want A2G Hard missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g hard missions active)
a2g_helo_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want A2G helo missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g helo missions active)
a2g_helo_inf_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want A2G helo infantry missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g helo infantry assault missions active)
antiship_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want anti-ship missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g missions active)




a2a_autospawn_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want random enemy A2A spawns 
a2a_intercept_autospawn_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want random enemy bomber spawns  
a2a_helo_autospawn_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want random enemy helo spawns  

a2a_respawn_time_min = 5
a2a_respawn_time_max = 20
a2a_intercept_respawn_time_min = 1680
a2a_intercept_respawn_time_max = 3420
a2a_helo_respawn_time_min = 1680
a2a_helo_respawn_time_max = 3420
(TIME IN SECONDS)
for a dynamic spawn time choose a minimum and maximum time between spawns or make them the same if you want a static time between spawns.


sam_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE DEPENDING ON IF YOU WANT THERE TO BE RANDOM SAM SITES SPAWNING ON THE MAP OUTSIDE OF MISSION ZONES 
sam_site_jtacs_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE IF YOU WANT JTACS THAT LASE/SMOKE AT THE RANDOM SAM SITES
sam_respawn_time = TIME IN SECONDS BETWEEN RANDOM SAM SITE SPAWN

jtac_smokes_targets = SET TRUE OR FALSE IF YOU WANT JTACS TO SMOKE LASED TARGETS!

enemy_ship_ai = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want enemy AI ships to attack/defend or do nothing.

random_fighter_air_traffic = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want random fighter jet air traffic doing their own thing at random airfields.


-- # of civ aircraft spawns PER TYPE,
civ_rat_spawns = the amount of civilian ai air traffic spawns per type 

-- set # of fighter aircraft spawns, for each type individually

max_distance_destination = the max distance to a random airfield the ai air traffic will travel to in KM

civ_allow_immortal = true or false to allow civ aircraft to be immortal
civ_allow_invisible = true or false to allow civ aircraft to be invisible

fighter_jet_combat_mode = set free/hold/return combat mode for fighter jets
-- free is weapons free, ai will go on offensive

HOW TO CHANGE UNIT SPAWNING POOL:


Simply add two dashes -- before the name of the unit you want to remove from the spawning pool.

EXAMPLE, to ensure the SA-10 doesn't spawn the line with "sam_s10" will look like this
 --"sam_s10"

DO NOT DO ANYTHING HERE EXCEPT ADD DASHES TO THE UNITS YOU WANT REMOVED FROM THE SPAWNING POOL.

 TemplateTable_SAM = { 
--"example of disabled unit"
"sam_s3",
"sam_s2",
"sam_s10",
"sam_s11",
"sam_s6",
 } 
 
  TemplateTable_AA = { 
"aa_ural",
"aa_shilka",
"aa_tunguska",
"aa_strella",
"aa_osa",
"aa_manpads",
 }
