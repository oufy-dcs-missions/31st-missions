______________

"ZEUS" MAP MARKER SPAWNS AND COMMANDS:
You can CREATE and DESTROY units out of thin air at ANY location you choose on the F10 map, like in "Zeus" mode from ArmA 3.

Create units:
1) Add a map marker of where you want to create a unit. DO NOT TYPE ANYTHING OR HIT ENTER JUST YET.

2) Type in "-create [NAME OF UNIT YOU WANT TO SPAWN FROM THE LIST]" DO NOT HIT ENTER OR LEAVE THE MARKER ON THE MAP JUST YET.
Example "-create f14_red" will create an element of REDFOR AI F-14's
"jtac" and "abrams" are friendly units to use combined arms with. Use the JTAC to spawn it anywhere to get a friend to control it for some fun Co-Op action!
Also, try creating your own ground attack units using the armor or infantry group spawn for an easier bulk spawn

UNITS CAN BE STACKED! Spawn as many of any unit as you like to create your own ground missions!
