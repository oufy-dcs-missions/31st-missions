HOW TO CHANGE MISSION SETTINGS:


GO TO THE TRIGGER LIST IN THE MISSION EDITOR (3rd icon under MIS on the LEFT PANEL)

On the FIRST TRIGGER, look in ACTIONS > DO SCRIPT.

There you can edit the number values for adjusting the mission properties.

AFTER EDITING, SAVE MISSION!!!!!

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE NUMBER VALUES!!!

This is what each setting does:


a2g_easy_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want A2G Easy missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g  hard missions active)
a2g_hard_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want A2G Hard missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g hard missions active)
a2g_helo_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want A2G helo missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g helo missions active)
a2g_helo_inf_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want A2G helo infantry missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g helo infantry assault missions active)
antiship_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want anti-ship missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g missions active)




a2a_autospawn_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want random enemy A2A spawns 
a2a_intercept_autospawn_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want random enemy bomber spawns  
a2a_helo_autospawn_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want random enemy helo spawns  

a2a_respawn_time_min = 5
a2a_respawn_time_max = 20
a2a_intercept_respawn_time_min = 1680
a2a_intercept_respawn_time_max = 3420
a2a_helo_respawn_time_min = 1680
a2a_helo_respawn_time_max = 3420
(TIME IN SECONDS)
for a dynamic spawn time choose a minimum and maximum time between spawns or make them the same if you want a static time between spawns.

HOW TO CHANGE UNIT SPAWNING POOL:


Simply add two dashes -- before the name of the unit you want to remove from the spawning pool.

EXAMPLE, to ensure the SA-10 doesn't spawn the line with "sam_s10" will look like this
 --"sam_s10"

DO NOT DO ANYTHING HERE EXCEPT ADD DASHES TO THE UNITS YOU WANT REMOVED FROM THE SPAWNING POOL.

 TemplateTable_SAM = { 
--"example of disabled unit"
"sam_s3",
"sam_s2",
"sam_s10",
"sam_s11",
"sam_s6",
 } 
 
  TemplateTable_AA = { 
"aa_ural",
"aa_shilka",
"aa_tunguska",
"aa_strella",
"aa_osa",
"aa_manpads",
 }
