Tips for running a private co-op server, adding more slots or adding AI wingmen.

To make more slots of an aircraft type, just add more planes to the client/player slots which have 1 of 1 plane in the squadron. Simply increase the second number up to 4 max to have more slots.
If you need more, you can copy and paste a slot as many times as you'd like.

To COPY and PASTE a playable slot, select an aircraft slot by clicking on it once to make it YELLOW.
Hit CTRL + C to copy and then hit CTRL + V to paste it.

Some users will experience a black screen or crash if they make their own aircraft from the ADD NEW AIRPLANE option in the mission editor instead of either copy+paste a slot or adding more to the group.

If you want AI wingmen, add more planes to the squadron of the slot you want to use, and MAKE SURE THEIR DIFFICULTY IS SET TO ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR PLAYER or CLIENT. 

Take note of the MISSION OPTIONS (Checkmark box on left side of the editor)
It'd be a good idea to make sure you change the options you want; No labels, no enemies on F10 map, etc...



WANT TO MOVE MISSION ZONES TO OTHER LOCATIONS?

EASY! You can do that! Just make sure to move the waypoints with them so that the WPT number text will reflect the correct location of your zone. The intel text with coordinates and GRID will adjust automatically, but the waypoints will not.
