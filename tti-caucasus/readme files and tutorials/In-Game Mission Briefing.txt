Super Carrier Static Deck Spawns Menu available! - Super Carrier Maps ONLY.

Big thanks to Redkite for allowing me to add these amazing static deck layouts for the Super Carrker.

You do not have to add these template scripts in yourself, you can simply adjust the layouts using the F10 Menu to add static layouts and remove them. You can mix and match as you please in REAL TIME during the mission.

AIRBOSS AVAILABLE FOR CARRIER OPS! (Not included on maps where carriers are not present)

______________

"ZEUS" MAP MARKER SPAWNS AND COMMANDS:
You can CREATE and DESTROY units out of thin air at ANY location you choose on the F10 map, like in "Zeus" mode from ArmA 3.

Create units:
1) Add a map marker of where you want to create a unit. DO NOT TYPE ANYTHING OR HIT ENTER JUST YET.

2) Type in "-create [NAME OF UNIT YOU WANT TO SPAWN FROM THE LIST]" DO NOT HIT ENTER OR LEAVE THE MARKER ON THE MAP JUST YET.
Example "-create f14_red" will create an element of REDFOR AI F-14's
"jtac" and "abrams" are friendly units to use combined arms with. Use the JTAC to spawn it anywhere to get a friend to control it for some fun Co-Op action!
Also, try creating your own ground attack units using the armor or infantry group spawn for an easier bulk spawn

UNITS CAN BE STACKED! Spawn as many of any unit as you like to create your own ground missions!
